            <h2>Dear gel,</h2>
            <p>Hello gel! I just want to let you know
                how much I admire you. From your gorgeous looks
                to your cute personality, I admire and adore it all.
                Since I started appreciating your beauty, you've never left my mind.
                Day-by-day I kept thinking about you, thinking how I, a mere mortal could 
                ever win the heart of a goddess such as you.
                I thought i was sick, but it turns out I was just madly in love, madly in love
                with you.
                <br>
                <br>
                I don't like taking risks, but if taking a risk means being with you for 
                the rest of my life, then I'll gladly take that risk. I like you, gel.
                I like you not just because of your looks, but also because of how good of a person you are.
                You have a strong and yet kind personality. If there's a girl
                that I could spend the rest of my life with, it would be you. I may not be
                the perfect man, but if you give the chance I would assure you that I'll always be here you, from
                the best and worst times of your life, espcially the worst.
